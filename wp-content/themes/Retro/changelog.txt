/*   Changelog   */

Remember: To easily update your theme, you can simply replace the whole
theme folder if you didn't modify any of the theme's files (or in this
case you'll have to re-apply the changes on the single files).
You'll not lose any setting, content, slide or custom sidebar.
Also, if new options have been added in the newer version, remember to
re-save your options or do a reset if possible.
