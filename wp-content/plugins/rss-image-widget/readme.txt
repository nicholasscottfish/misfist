Tested up to: 3.7
Stable tag: 1.4.2

This plugin provides you with a widget to display images from a feed. It requires the SimplePie plugin to be installed.

== Description ==

This Widget uses automatically downloads each image to cache it locally. These are cached inside `wp-content/cache` so please ensure that the directory is writable. If your images still don't appear check to see that they're readable inside the cache.

Image Feeds will work in the plugin providing that they use enclosures. If you want you can change the template provided to suit your feed if necessary, though this should work if enclosures are used correctly.

I have set the default image width in the template to be 150 pixels wide. You can change these options in the widget area.

SimplePie plugin is no longer required for this plugin as it now ships with Wordpress 2.8 and above! 

Next version will include some extra options and possibly better HTML.

* Link to full image or enclosure URL option
* PHPThumb reflection option (and other options)
* Some cache options
* Much more
 
Please be aware that I'll only be updating this if I need to. Feel free to come on board and contribute!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Images aren't appearing =

Usually any problem is related to the cache, and write permissions to that cache. Check the permissions for `wp-content/cache`.

The other issue could be that your feed doesn't have enclosures. If you don't know what this is please read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_enclosure
